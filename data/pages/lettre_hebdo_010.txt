===== Nouvelles générales de la communauté =====

==== Ubuntu wins the Golden Penguin Award ====

As reported in the Fridge, Ubuntu won the Golden Penguin Award at LinuxWorld Expo 2006, playing against the Novell OpenAudio team. The Ubuntu team, consisting of volunteers Jorge Castro, Corey Burger and Canonical's Malcolm Yates, led the scoring from the very beginning and despite the Novell team's strong showing the the 3rd round, Ubuntu finished ahead. Congrats to all the players. See more at the Fridge:

==== LinuxWorld Expo a great success ====

LinuxWorld Expo in San Francisco recently finished, and both the Ubuntu community and Canonical had a strong showing. Both booths were very busy, with many people discussing how they used Ubuntu or thanking us for making Ubuntu. The .org pavilion booth, run by the Ubuntu California team, was busy demonstrating Ubuntu 6.06 and all the great Ubuntu books currently out, while the Canonical booth focused on working business-to-business relationships.

At the GNOME booth, Ubuntu and GNOME community members Jorge Castro and Corey Burger helped the GNOME Foundation spread the message about how great GNOME was, which included showcasing the many great features coming both in GNOME 2.16 (due in Edgy) and beyond. Anecdotal evidence suggests an overwhelming number of visitors to the GNOME booth ran Ubuntu.

===== Ubuntu Summer of Code update =====

This week we profile Peter Moberg, who is currently working on two tools for Ubuntu as part of SoC. 

His first tool, called Panel Switcher, is designed to make switching panel layouts, even quite complicated ones, very easy. Implemented in Python and pyGTK, you can find more information at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/PanelSwitcher .

Session Backup, his other tool, allows a user to save and restore multiple GNOME sessions. As it stores the data in a zipped file, it also allows users to migrate that information to other computers. Also implemented in Python and pyGTK, you can find more information about Session Backup at https://wiki.ubuntu.com/SessionBackup .

===== Weekly developer meeting =====

In the most recent developer meeting - 17 August at 23:00 UTC in #ubuntu-meeting - the developers planned the list of topics to be discussed at next week's Development Sprint in Wiesbaden, Germany.

A number of features were reported as implemented or complete, including:

  * the speakup kernel module
  * boot-message-logging
  * kubuntu-accessibility 
  * Firefox 2.0 beta merge.

The desktop team is keeping very busy with bug triaging and fixing - and could use your help!

==== Ubuntu and Other Distros Rolled Out to American Students ====

     ''"Students in Indiana are using new Linux desktops under a state grant program to roll out low-cost workstations to schools. More than 22,000 kids have been Linuxed up under the programme which is being run by the Indiana Department of Education. Mike Huffman, special assistant for technology told CRN that Linux workstations were rolled out for 22,000 students over the last year under the Affordable Classroom Computers for Every Secondary Student (ACCESS) programme. The plan is to expand that even further with Novell SUSE, Red Hat and Ubuntu installations. Currently, 24 high schools are using Linux and the plan is to increase that to 80."''

===== À la une cette semaine - GNOME Deskbar =====

Deskbar allows you to embed an incredibly powerful search interface in a GNOME panel. Search across multiple search engines, enter an email address to send email, jump straight to a web page by entering the URL, or open files and folders by entering the path. There really are too many features to list. To see them all, and what's in store for future versions, visit Raphael Slinckx's blog at: http://raphael.slinckx.net/deskbar/

To add the Deskbar applet to your desktop just right click on an existing GNOME panel, select '''Add to Panel''', and select it from the applets listed in the '''Accessories''' section.
