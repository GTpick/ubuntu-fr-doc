==== New Apps ====

Late in the Ubuntu 6.06 LTS development cycle some new applications made their way into the distribution. SUN's Java and VMware's VMware Player made their way into Ubuntu 6.06 allowing them to be used and installed just like any other software in the archive.

 NOTE: If you are unfamiliar with installing new software please see: https://wiki.ubuntu.com/InstallingSoftware

=== SUN's Java ===

Sun's new CEO, Jonathan Schwartz, announced the new Distributor License for Java (DLJ) during his keynote at this year's ``Java``One conference. This new license makes it possible for distributors, specifically Ubuntu and Debian, to ship Java packaged as part of the distribution. On top of that, Java has already been packaged up and is in Multiverse, ready for use. The JRE (Java Runtime Environment) package is named '''sun-java5-jre''' and the JDK (Java Development Kit) package is named '''sun-java5-jdk'''.

For more information about the announcement, see:

 http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS6957752431.html

=== VMware Player ===

VMware Player is a popular operating system virtualization package which is great for machine consolidation and software testing. Installing VMware Player used to involve installing and compiling a bunch of stuff that can be difficult for new users. VMware Player is now available in the Ubuntu archive in the Multiverse repository. The VMware Player package is named '''vmware-player'''.

===== In The Press =====

==== iTWire ====

The author of this iTWire article feels that Linux on SPARC may not be successful. We disagree, but it's an interesting read nonetheless:

 '''Sun job cuts and Linux on Sparc will fail says analyst''' - http://www.itwire.com.au/content/view/4491/53/

Article Quote:

"Now people just don't care because what they really want to buy is commodity servers. Commodity means low cost and high volume and for that people have traditionally bought Intel. In short, three years down the track Linux on Sparc, like Suse Linux on mainframes, will be considered just another interesting Linux diversion."

==== Top Tech News ====

 '''Sun Adds Ubuntu Linux to Sparc Servers''' - http://www.toptechnews.com/story.xhtml?story_id=001000000XOC

Article Quote:

"The problem with Linux is that there are too many distributions available," said Joe Wilcox, an analyst at Jupiter Research. "What Ubuntu is trying to do is take the complexity out of Linux, which has been holding back more widespread acceptance."
